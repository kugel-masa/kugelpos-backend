Session helper for Dapr state store HTTP operations with connection pooling.

This module provides a module-level shared aiohttp session for Dapr state store
operations to improve performance by reusing HTTP connections instead of creating
new sessions for every request.

Performance Impact:
    Without pooling: 50-100ms overhead per request for session creation
    With pooling: ~1-5ms per request (connection reuse)

    For 1884 Add Item requests (15 users, 10 min):
    - Before: 3768 session creations = 188-376 seconds overhead
    - After: 1 session creation = ~1 second overhead
    - Expected reduction: 99.5-99.7% in connection overhead

    Get or create a shared aiohttp session for Dapr state store operations.

    This function implements the singleton pattern for aiohttp.ClientSession,
    creating a single session with connection pooling that is reused across
    all Dapr state store operations (GET, POST, DELETE).

    Connection Pool Configuration:
        - limit=100: Maximum 100 concurrent connections across all hosts
        - limit_per_host=50: Maximum 50 connections to Dapr sidecar (localhost:3500)
        - ttl_dns_cache=300: DNS cache TTL of 5 minutes (localhost doesn't need frequent refresh)

    Timeout Configuration:
        - total=10.0s: Maximum time for complete request/response cycle
        - connect=3.0s: Maximum time to establish connection (localhost should be immediate)
        - sock_read=5.0s: Maximum time to read response data

    Returns:
        aiohttp.ClientSession: Shared session with connection pooling

    Example:
        >>> session = await get_dapr_statestore_session()
        >>> async with session.post(url, json=data) as response:
        ...     result = await response.json()
