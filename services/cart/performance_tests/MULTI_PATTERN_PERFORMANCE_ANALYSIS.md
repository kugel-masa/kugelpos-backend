## Statistical Variability Analysis

### Add Item Operation - Response Time Consistency

| Pattern | Average (ms) | Std Dev (ms) | CV (%) | Interpretation |
|---------|--------------|--------------|--------|----------------|
| 20 users | 83.8 | 96.1 | 114.7% | High variability |
| 30 users | 107.8 | 184.2 | 170.9% | Very high variability |
| 40 users | 88.0 | 116.1 | 131.9% | High variability |
| 50 users* | 87.8 | 96.1 | 109.4% | High variability |

*50-user test interrupted

**Note:** Standard deviation estimated from percentile distribution using p95-p50 relationship.

### Coefficient of Variation (CV) Analysis

**CV Interpretation Guidelines:**
- **CV < 15%:** Excellent consistency
- **CV 15-30%:** Good consistency
- **CV 30-50%:** Moderate variability
- **CV 50-100%:** High variability
- **CV > 100%:** Very high variability

**Key Findings:**

1. **All patterns show very high variability (CV > 100%)**
   - This indicates response times are highly unpredictable
   - Users may experience inconsistent performance
   - System is likely experiencing resource contention or queueing

2. **Peak variability at 30 users (CV = 170.9%)**
   - Standard deviation (184.2ms) is **1.7x larger** than mean (107.8ms)
   - Response time range: 34ms (min) to 2,937ms (max) = **86x difference**
   - Suggests system enters unstable state at this load level

3. **Improving trend at 40-50 users**
   - CV decreases from 170.9% → 131.9% → 109.4%
   - However, this may be due to test interruption and reduced sample size
   - Absolute request volume dropped dramatically (2,244 → 859 → 950)

4. **Best consistency at 50 users (109.4%)**
   - Lowest CV among all patterns, but still very high
   - Likely artifact of early termination (only 950 requests vs. 2,934 at 20 users)
   - Max response time also lowest (547ms vs. 2,937ms at 30 users)

### Variability Degradation Pattern

| Transition | CV Change | Interpretation |
|------------|-----------|----------------|
| 20 → 30 users | +56.2 pp (114.7% → 170.9%) | Significant degradation |
| 30 → 40 users | -39.0 pp (170.9% → 131.9%) | Improvement (likely due to reduced load) |
| 40 → 50 users | -22.5 pp (131.9% → 109.4%) | Improvement (test interrupted) |

**Analysis:**
The improvement in CV from 30 to 50 users is counterintuitive and likely indicates:
1. Reduced effective load due to failed requests or timeouts
2. Survivor bias (only fastest requests completed before crash)
3. System shedding load before complete failure

### Response Time Distribution Characteristics

**Skewness Analysis (from percentiles):**

| Pattern | p50 (ms) | p95 (ms) | p95/p50 Ratio | Skewness |
|---------|----------|----------|---------------|----------|
| 20 users | 42 | 200 | 4.76x | High right skew |
| 30 users | 47 | 350 | 7.45x | Very high right skew |
| 40 users | 59 | 250 | 4.24x | High right skew |
| 50 users* | 61 | 220 | 3.61x | Moderate right skew |

**Interpretation:**
- All distributions show **right-skewed** response times (long tail)
- Most requests complete quickly (42-61ms median)
- Small percentage of requests experience severe delays (200-350ms at p95)
- Suggests occasional resource contention, lock waiting, or GC pauses

---

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Service Unreachable at 50 Users

**Symptom:**
- Cart service became UNREACHABLE during 50-user load test
- Test was interrupted before completion
- Only 1,007 total requests completed vs. expected ~3,000+

**Evidence:**
- Stats history shows only 377 lines vs. 597 for successful tests
- Request counts significantly lower: 50 carts created vs. 125-157 in other tests
- Only 7 cancel operations completed vs. 16-138 in other tests

**Root Cause Analysis Required:**
- Memory exhaustion possible
- Connection pool saturation
- Database connection limits
- Thread/async task pool exhaustion
- Resource contention in fire-and-forget logging

### 2. Throughput Anomaly at 40 Users

**Observation:**
- 40-user test shows **higher RPS** (7.30) than 30-user test (4.12)
- Suggests test may have terminated early or had different runtime conditions

**Possible Causes:**
- Test duration variance
- Early termination
- Service restart between tests
- Cache effects

### 3. Cancel Operation Performance Degradation

**Issue:**
- Cancel cart operation shows **severe performance degradation**
- Response times 3-5x slower than other operations
- Volume drops dramatically under load

**Impact:**
- User experience severely degraded for cancellations
- Potential timeout issues in production
- May indicate database lock contention or inefficient transaction rollback

## Comparison with Previous Results

### Fire-and-Forget Logging (Current Implementation)

**From FIRE_AND_FORGET_LOGGING_PERFORMANCE_REPORT.md:**
- 20 users: 4.51 req/s, 97ms median
- Current 20 users: 5.39 req/s, 44ms median

**Improvement:**
- +19.5% throughput increase
- +54.6% response time improvement

**Analysis:**
This suggests recent optimizations have improved baseline performance, but scaling characteristics remain problematic.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Priority 1)

1. **Investigate Service Crash at 50 Users**
   - Review cart service logs for memory/resource exhaustion
   - Monitor heap usage, GC activity, connection pools
   - Identify specific failure point (OOM, connection timeout, etc.)
   - Check for asyncio task queue overflow

2. **Address High Response Time Variability (CV > 100%)**
   - **Root cause:** CV of 114-171% indicates severe performance unpredictability

3. **Scaling Factor:** ~71% request volume reduction from 20→40 users indicates poor scaling characteristics
4. **Critical Path:** Cancel cart operation is the primary performance bottleneck (3.9s max latency)
5. **Stability:** Zero failed requests in successful tests demonstrates good error handling within capacity limits
6. **Performance Unpredictability:** Very high CV (109-171%) indicates severe response time inconsistency
   - Users may experience 2-86x variation in response times
   - Peak variability occurs at 30 concurrent users
   - System exhibits resource contention or queueing delays under load

### Performance Quality Assessment

| Aspect | Rating | Evidence |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **Throughput** | ⚠️ Poor | 71% degradation from 20→40 users |
| **Latency (Median)** | ⚠️ Moderate | 45% increase (42ms → 61ms) |
| **Consistency** | ❌ Critical | CV > 100% = very high variability |
| **Reliability** | ✅ Good | 0% failures within capacity |
| **Scalability** | ❌ Critical | Service crash at 50 users |

### Next Steps

1. **Immediate:** Execute 45-user test to identify exact failure threshold
2. **Immediate:** Review cart service logs during 50-user test for crash analysis
3. **Immediate:** Profile and fix high response time variability (CV > 100%)
4. **Short-term:** Implement monitoring dashboards for resource utilization, CV, and percentile latencies
5. **Medium-term:** Optimize cancel cart operation (current bottleneck)
6. **Long-term:** Plan capacity improvements targeting 100+ concurrent users
7. **Long-term:** Consider architecture changes for better horizontal scalability
